Description: This module provides a facility to define recursive functions in
   an ML-like style, giving a fixpoint equation, a variant and a
   well-founded relation. A pure function is then generated, together with 
   a theorem giving the fixpoint equation. 
   THIS IS MAINLY A TEST CONTRIB, BEFORE INTEGRATION IN COQ.
Keywords: recursive functions, well founded recursion, well foundedness
